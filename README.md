A mod for Minecraft that adds a lot of **farming related machines**, aiming to further extend the capabilities introduced by [Tech Reborn](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn).

Marvelous machines introduces new blocks like:

* [Planter](../../wiki/Planter): Plants food crops and tree saplings automatically. *
* [Fertilizer](../../wiki/Fertilizer): Automated fertilization of food crops and tree saplings when provided with enough bonemeal. *
* [Harvester](../../wiki/Harvester): Harvest food crops automatically, similar to the *Greenhouse controller*. The harvester though will produce [sewage](../../wiki/Sewage) that can be further processed to obtain [mud](../../wiki/Mud-block), fertilizer or biofuel. *
* [Log breaker](../../wiki/Log-breaker): Breaks wooden blocks right in front of the machine. A very crude tree cutter when stacked!
* [Tree cutter](../../wiki/Tree-cutter): A more advanced log breaker! Chops down full trees automatically, including logs and leaves.
* [Water treatment plant](../../wiki/Water-treatment-plant): Recycles [sewage](../../wiki/Sewage) and other fluids, producing [mud](../../wiki/Mud-block). Good for the environment! ðŸŒ´ *
* [Stone breaker](../../wiki/Stone-breaker): Allows building an automated cobblestone generator using old-school flowing water and lava.
* [Block breaker](../../wiki/Block-breaker): A more advanced stone breaker! Breaks almost any block right in front of the machine. Use it wisely.
* [Fluid Outlet](../../wiki/Fluid-outlet): Places any fluid from its internal tank right in front of the machine. *
* [Fisher](../../wiki/Fisher): Catches fish from the sea (and quite often some garbage as well). *
* [Color extractor](../../wiki/Color-extractor): Generates dye colors by processing blocks, e.g. recycling sand blocks to get yellow dye. *
* [Concrete mixer](../../wiki/Concrete-mixer): Forms concrete automatically when provided with concrete powder and water. *

(* these are currently in development; you can expect them soon)

All introduced machines are based on the Tech Reborn [API](https://github.com/TechReborn/RebornCore) and thus fully compatible with the power and item mechanics.
