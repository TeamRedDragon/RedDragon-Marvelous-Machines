A mod for Minecraft that adds a lot of farming related machines, aiming to further extend the capabilities introduced by [Tech Reborn](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn).

It includes new machines like:

* [Planter](../../wiki/Planter): Allows planting food crops and tree saplings automatically.
* [Fertilizer](../../wiki/Fertilizer): Allows automated fertilization of food crops and tree saplings when provided with enough bonemeal.
* [Harvester](../../wiki/Harvester): Allows harvesting food crops automatically, similiar to the *Greenhouse controller*. The harvester though will produce [sewage](../../wiki/Sewage) that can be further processed to obtain [mud](../../wiki/Mud-block), fertilizer or biofuel.
* [Log breaker](../../wiki/Log-breaker): Allows breaking wooden blocks right in front of the machine. A very crude tree cutter!
* [Tree cutter](../../wiki/Tree-cutter): A more advanced log breaker! Allows chopping down full trees automatically, including logs and leaves.
* [Water treatment plant](../../wiki/Water-treatment-plant): Allows recycling of [sewage](../../wiki/Sewage) and other fluids to produce [mud](../../wiki/Mud-block). Good for the environment! ðŸŒ´
* [Stone breaker](../../wiki/Stone-breaker): Allows building an automated cobblestone generator using water and lava.
* [Block breaker](../../wiki/Block-breaker): A more advanced stone breaker! Allows breaking almost any block right in front of the machine. Use it wisely.
* [Color extractor](../../wiki/Color-extractor): Allows to retrieve dye colors from processing blocks, such as recycling sand block to get yellow dye.

All introduced machines are based on the Tech Reborn [API](https://github.com/TechReborn/RebornCore) and thus fully compatible with the power and item mechanics.
