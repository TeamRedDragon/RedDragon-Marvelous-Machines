# RedDragon Marvelous Machines

A fabric-based mod for Minecraft that adds a lot of farming related machine blocks, aiming to further extend the machines available by [Tech Reborn](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn). All machines are based on the Tech Reborn API and thus fully compatible with the power and item dispatch system.

* Planter: Allows planting food crops and tree saplings automatically.
* Fertilizer: Allows automated fertilization of food crops and tree saplings when provided with enough bonemeal.
* Harvester: Allows harvesting food crops automatically, similiar to the *Greenhouse controller*. This machine will produce sewage though that can be further processed to obtain mud, fertilizer or biofuel.
* Log breaker: Allows breaking wooden blocks right in front of the machine. A very crude tree cutter!
* Tree cutter: A more advanced log breaker! Allows chopping down full trees automatically, including logs and leaves.
* Water treatment plant: Allows recycling of sewage and other fluids to produce mud. Good for the environment!
* Stone breaker: Allows building an automated cobblestone generator using water and lava.
* Block breaker: A more advanced stone breaker! Allows breaking almost any block right in front of the machine. Use it wisely.
