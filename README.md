# RedDragon Marvelous Machines

A mod for Minecraft that adds a lot of farming related machines, aiming to further extend the capabilities introduced by [Tech Reborn](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn). It includes new machines like:

* **Planter**: Allows planting food crops and tree saplings automatically.
* **Fertilizer**: Allows automated fertilization of food crops and tree saplings when provided with enough bonemeal.
* **Harvester**: Allows harvesting food crops automatically, similiar to the *Greenhouse controller*. This machine will produce sewage though that can be further processed to obtain mud, fertilizer or biofuel.
* **Log breaker**: Allows breaking wooden blocks right in front of the machine. A very crude tree cutter!
* **Tree cutter**: A more advanced log breaker! Allows chopping down full trees automatically, including logs and leaves.
* **Water treatment plant**: Allows recycling of sewage and other fluids to produce mud. Good for the environment!
* **Stone breaker**: Allows building an automated cobblestone generator using water and lava.
* **Block breaker**: A more advanced stone breaker! Allows breaking almost any block right in front of the machine. Use it wisely.
* **Color extractor**: Allows to retrieve dye colors from processing blocks, such as recycling sand block to get yellow dye.

All machines are based on the Tech Reborn [API](https://github.com/TechReborn/RebornCore) and thus fully compatible with the power and item mechanics.
